This is our home, Prairie! It’s made of several floating islands, and home to a many dogpeople, and even a few catpeople! Prairie was built upon the ruins of an ancient civilisation; many relics have been found around the land. These relics are very precious, because they hold mystical powers. They are a part of our heritage, and a very important part of our daily lives. We know very little about the ancient civilisation that preceded us, or how they perished, nor we know much about the artifacts they left behind. All we’re left with is a big mystery.

Considérées comme des trésors elles renferment de mystérieux pouvoirs et ont permis à Prairie de prospérer en servant de monnaie d'échange. Le peuple de Prairie vit parmi les vestiges. Mais, quel type de civilisation les Anciens ont-ils pu développer ? Pour quelle raison ces derniers ont-ils disparu ? La vérité, personne ne la connaît…

A floating world constituted of about ten islands: that is our nation, Prairie.

Considered treasures, they hold mysterious powers, allowing Prairie to prosper, serving as a form of currency. The people of Prairie lives amidst the ruins, but… What kind of civilisation could be the one the Ancients lived in? And what was the reason of their demise? No one knows the truth…
