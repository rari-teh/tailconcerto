He was a giant who could reach the clouds. He was born of a man of diminutive stature who had eaten the seeds of wisdom. Iron scraps and a pinch of sand were his womb. His first bath was a smelter, and his first breath was filled with hatred. His arms touched the clouds, his roar shook the heavens and his breath froze the land. He struck fear into those who stood in his way, and he left nothing but silence in his wake.

Frôlant les nuages de sa hauteur, il était le géant. Son père fut un nain qui mangea une graine de savoir et sa mère, une pincée de sable et d'acier. Nouveau-né, il baigna dans du mercure glacé et sa première plainte fut un cri de haine. Son bras atteignait les nuages… Son cri de guerre faisait trembler les cieux… Le souffle de sa respiration glaçait la Terre… Ses apparitions semaient le désespoir et ses départs ramenaient le calme et la tranquilité…

Grazing the clouds at his height, he was the giant. His father was a dwarf who had eaten a seed of wisdom, and his mother, a pinch of sand and steel. As a newborn, he bathed in the icy mercury, and his first cry was that of hatred. His arms reached the clouds… His war cry shook the heavens… His breath froze the Earth… His presence sowed despair, and his departure brought back calm and tranquility…

Grazing the clouds at his height, he was the giant. He was born of a dwarf who had eaten a seed of wisdom; a pinch of sand and steel filings were his womb. As a newborn, he was bathed in mercury, and his first cry was one of hatred. His arms reached the clouds… His roar shook the heavens… His breath froze the land… His presence brought despair, and only his departure could restore serenity and peace.
